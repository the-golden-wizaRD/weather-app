# weather-app
A weather app project for practicing ES6 and asynchronous javascript

Everything build on this site can be developed in one single HTML5 file, but I used various technologies like webpack etc just to practice these technologies. There's no better project than a weather app to practice any skill.
Technologies and practices used : Webpack, Sass, HTML, JavaScript,npm, Modular Programming,Git, GitHub, Netlify
